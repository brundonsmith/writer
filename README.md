Simple writing/note-taking Electron app that I'm creating because I don't like the existing options.

Key features planned:
- Extremely minimal and distraction-free UI
- Simplicity of creation/management of notes (like Apple notes)
- No rich-text formatting to complicate controls and mess up copying/pasting into things like emails (unlike Apple Notes)
- A centered layout with a finite width, so that you get natural line wrapping when writing longform (this one is the hardest to find among other applications)
- Simple, text-file-based persistence for maximum portability and compatibility with things like Dropbox

Extra features I may or may not add later:
- Simple highlighting of Markdown syntax (bold headings, for example) a la VSCode. Not going to bother with a full-on markdown preview.
- More interesting backgrounds/themes similar to [OmmWriter](https://ommwriter.com/)
